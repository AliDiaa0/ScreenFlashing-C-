# ScreenFlashing-C-
This is the same screen flashing program that I created, but this time, it is written completely in C++.

It is very simple and basic console application that performs a screen flashing GDI payload, and the user is allowed to choose the times of flashing and delay. Unfortunately, this program is only able to run on the stupid Microsoft Windows, from Windows XP to Windows 11, 32-bit or 64-bit, on all versions and editions. Just make sure that your Windows itself is working, haha.

If you want to get the executable file, go to the Release folder and find it there. :)

Please do not steal it and claim that it is your own work. Respect my code. =)
